Initial development was part of the \"Geothermal Supermodels\" research project, funded by the NZ Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment ( MBIE ), with additional support from Contact Energy Ltd . The word Waiwera comes from the M\u0101ori language and means \"hot water\".","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"contrib/","text":"Contributing to Waiwera Because Waiwera is released under a free, open-source license , you may contribute code. Waiwera's source code is written in Fortran 2003, so you will need to be familiar with that in order to contribute. You will also need to know how to use the Git version control system. Pull requests You can contribute code to Waiwera by submitting a \" pull request \". To do this, first you need to fork the Waiwera repository and check it out onto your local machine. You can commit your changes locally and then push them back up to your fork on Github. Finally, you can make a pull request on the Waiwera repository. Your proposed changes will then be reviewed, discussed and altered as necessary. If it is agreed that your changes are appropriate then they will be merged into the Waiwera code. Unit tests Waiwera uses a test-driven development cycle, so in general any new code should be accompanied by unit tests to make sure it works correctly. Waiwera uses the Zofu library for creating unit tests. Reporting issues You can also help improve Waiwera by reporting any issues .","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contrib/#contributing-to-waiwera","text":"Because Waiwera is released under a free, open-source license , you may contribute code.
